### Problem: Forecasting for a Bike rental demand

#### Problem Description

This analysis attempts to generate a time series model based to predict daily rental demand of bicycles. The training dataset on the daily number of bicycles checkouts from a bike sharing service, is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict the next 30 days of demand.


#### Tasks & approach

Identify possible trend or seasonality and predict future demand at a bike-sharing service using Arima and Holt-Winters models and generating a basic forecast. 
Although there are other machine learning models that could offer better predictions, Times series will be analyzed for forecasting.
Steps will be explained in the following slides.

Process following Ruslana Dalinina, with subtles additions as:
- Test for additive or multiplicative seasonality
- Splitting in train and test data before the generation of the models.
- Adding an Exponential smoothing approach for forecasting
